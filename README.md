# Elevating NFTs with ZetaChain: Omnichain NFTs

## Overview

Here, you will embark on an exciting journey to develop an NFT omnichain smart contract with ZetaChain. This contract is designed to mint NFTs in reaction to token deposits from various connected chains, including Bitcoin. The innovative approach allows users to 'deposit' native EVM tokens into these NFTs, transfer them to different addresses, and provides options for burning NFTs to claim the 'deposited' tokens.
